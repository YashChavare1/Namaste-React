Optimizing the Application

 1. code splitting
 2. dynamic bundling 
 3. chunking
 4. Lazy Loading
 5. On demand loading
All above things are same


we can do code splitting of diffent features like makeMyTrip have flight, trains, hotels and flight, trains and hotels can have 100s of component 
- so we can make different bundle for flights, trains, and hotels so the size of js bundle file can be reduced and optimized
